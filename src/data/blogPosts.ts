        content: `
            <p>Japanese motorcycle auctions are famous for their strict inspection systems. Every bike that goes through the auction is inspected by a professional evaluator who assigns it an overall grade as well as individual grades for the engine, frame, exterior, and electricals.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding the Overall Grades</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade S:</strong> Brand new, never registered.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade 5:</strong> Like new, very low mileage.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade 4:</strong> Good condition, minor scratches or wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade 3:</strong> Average condition, visible wear, scratches, or minor dents.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade R:</strong> Repaired history (accident history).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Inspection Points</h3>
            <p>Inspectors check hundreds of points on every bike. They listen to the engine for abnormal noises, check the frame for bends or stoppers damage, and test the electrical components.</p>
